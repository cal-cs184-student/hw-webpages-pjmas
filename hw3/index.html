		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this project, I implemented a path tracer capable of rendering photorealistic images by simulating 
		realistic light behavior. Path tracing involves tracing rays from the camera through each pixel in the 
		scene and recursively calculating the contributions of direct and indirect lighting at each intersection. 
		To improve efficiency, I built a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) to accelerate ray-primitive intersections, 
		reducing the computational complexity. For direct illumination, I implemented both uniform hemisphere 
		sampling and light importance sampling, ensuring more accurate lighting calculations. Indirect illumination 
		was handled using recursive ray tracing with Russian Roulette termination to probabilistically decide 
		whether to continue bouncing or terminate the ray.

		Additionally, I implemented adaptive sampling to dynamically determine the number of samples required for 
		each pixel, reducing noise while improving performance. The algorithm monitored the variance of the sampled 
		illuminance and stopped sampling once it detected that the pixel had converged.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		<p>
			Camera ray generation is a crucial step in the rendering pipeline, as it allows us to cast 
			rays from the cameraâ€™s position through each pixel on the screen, simulating how light would 
			travel to the camera. The direction of each ray corresponds to the pixelâ€™s location on the 
			image plane, effectively mapping the 3D scene to 2D image space. To generate these rays in 
			world space, we first convert the image space coordinates (x, y) to camera space, representing 
			the points we want to sample. After generating the ray in camera space, it is transformed into 
			world space, where it is ready to be traced through the 3D scene. Additionally, multiple rays 
			can be generated per pixel for techniques like anti-aliasing, which reduces visual artifacts 
			by sampling rays that are slightly offset from the center of the pixel, ensuring smoother 
			and more accurate image results.
		</p>
		<p>
			Primitive intersection is essential in the ray tracing pipeline because it helps determine 
			where a generated ray intersects with objects in the scene, which is made up of various primitives 
			like triangles, spheres, and other shapes. Detecting these intersections is crucial for understanding 
			the interactions between the ray and the scene, such as identifying the exact point of contact and 
			the associated surface properties, like the surface normal or texture coordinates. This process 
			allows the rendering system to build a more accurate representation of how rays interact with the 
			scene, which is key to generating the final image.
		</p>
		<p>
			The triangle intersection algorithm I implemented works by testing if a given ray intersects 
			with a triangle in 3D space:
			<ul>
				<li>Edge Vectors: The algorithm calculates the triangleâ€™s edges by subtracting its vertices.</li>
				<li>Cross Product: The cross product of the ray's direction (d) and one triangle edge (e2) is computed to check if the ray is parallel to the triangle.</li>
				<li>Determinant Check: The determinant is calculated using the cross product and one triangle edge (e1). If it's near zero, the ray is parallel, and no intersection occurs.</li>
				<li>Barycentric Coordinates: The algorithm computes beta and gamma using the rayâ€™s origin and the triangleâ€™s edges to check if the intersection lies inside the triangle. If not, the ray misses the triangle.</li>
				<li>Intersection Point: The intersection distance (t) is calculated. If t is within the valid range (min_t to max_t), the intersection is valid.</li>
				<li>Update Intersection Data: If valid, the intersection point, normal, and material properties are stored for further processing.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
		<p>
			I chose to split along the axis with the largest extent because it helps create a more balanced tree by dividing primitives where they are most spread out. For the split point, I used the midpoint of the bounding box along that axis, as itâ€™s simple and effective. If all primitives ended up on one side (e.g., due to overlapping centroids), I forced a split by dividing them into two equal groups to avoid infinite recursion. This heuristic ensures the BVH is balanced and minimizes overlap, making ray traversal faster.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my BVH construction algorithm, I take the following steps to build a balanced BVH tree:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Start with Primitives: I begin with a list of primitives and compute their combined bounding box.
				</li>
				<li>
					Check for Leaf Node: If the number of primitives is small enough (â‰¤ max_leaf_size), I create a leaf node, store the primitives, and stop recursion.
				</li>
				<li>
					Choose Split point: I calculate the extent of the bounding box along each axis (x, y, z) and pick the axis with the largest extent. This ensures the split happens where primitives are most spread out.
				</li>
				<li>
					Splitting the Primitives: After selecting the axis with the largest extent, I compute the midpoint of the bounding box along that axis. I use this midpoint as the split point to divide the primitives into two groups. To ensure a balanced split and avoid infinite recursion (in cases where all primitives end up on one side), I use a heuristic: if all primitives are on one side, I force the split by dividing the group into two equal parts.
				</li>
				<li>
					Recursive Construction: With the split point determined, I recursively build the left and right child nodes by calling the construct_bvh function on each group of primitives. This recursive process continues until all leaf nodes are small enough to hold the primitives directly.
				</li>
				<li>
					Returning the Node: After recursively building the left and right subtrees, I create a new BVHNode and assign the left and right child nodes to it. This node is then returned to its parent, continuing the process until the entire BVH tree is constructed.
				</li>
			</ul>

			For beast.dae with 64,618 primitives, rendering without a BVH took 360 seconds (6 minutes),

		<h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
		<div>
			<h4>Uniform Hemisphere Sampling</h4>
			<p>
				To estimate direct lighting, we cast <code>num_samples</code> rays from the point of intersection 
				(<code>hit_p</code>) into the scene. The directions (<code>wi</code>) of these rays are sampled 
				uniformly from the hemisphere using <code>hemisphereSampler->get_sample()</code>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For each sampled direction, a ray is cast from <code>hit_p</code> to check for intersections 
				using <code>bvh->intersect</code>. If the ray hits an emissive object, we calculate the emitted 
				light using <code>bsdf->get_emission()</code>. The contribution of this light is scaled by the 
				BSDF value (<code>bsdf->f</code>) and the cosine of the angle between <code>wi</code> and the 
				surface normal at the intersection (<code>isect.n</code>).
			</p>
			<p>
				All the contributions from the sampled directions are accumulated, and the final value is 
				normalized by dividing the sum by <code>num_samples</code>. This normalized result is returned 
				as the estimated direct lighting.
			</p>
			<h4>Importance Sampling Lights</h4>
			<p>
				From the intersection point (<code>hit_p</code>), we sample directions (<code>wi</code>) 
				toward each light source in the scene using <code>light->sample_L</code>. 
				For point lights (<code>is_delta_light()</code>), we sample only once, while 
				for area lights, we sample <code>ns_area_light</code> times.
			</p>
			<p>
				For each sampled direction, a shadow ray is cast from <code>hit_p</code> toward the light source. 
				The rayâ€™s minimum distance (<code>ray.min_t</code>) is set to <code>EPS_F</code> to avoid self-intersection, 
				and the maximum distance (<code>ray.max_t</code>) is set to <code>distToLight - EPS_F</code> 
				to avoid overshooting the light.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the shadow ray does not hit any object (checked using <code>bvh->intersect</code>), 
				the emission is taken from the light using <code>bsdf->get_emission()</code>. 
				This emission is then scaled by the BSDF value (<code>bsdf->f</code>) and the cosine of the angle 
				between <code>wi</code> and the surface normal at the intersection (<code>isect.n</code>).

		<p>
			From the above pictures, itâ€™s clear that the results of hemisphere sampling and light sampling differ 
			significantly in terms of lighting smoothness and consistency. In the hemisphere sampling render, 
			especially with just a single light ray, the shadows appear grainy and sharp, indicating a high level 
			of noise. As the number of light rays increases, the shadows become smoother, but there is still 
			noticeable speckling on surfaces like the walls. This effect occurs because hemisphere sampling 
			distributes rays randomly, leading to inconsistent lighting levels across neighboring pixels. 
			On the other hand, the render using light sampling, which targets light sources directly, results 
			in much more even lighting. The lighting levels between adjacent pixels are more consistent, 
			contributing to a smoother and more natural look overall. Additionally, the hemisphere sampling 
			render appears darker compared to the light sampling one, as not every ray in the former reaches 
			a light source, whereas all rays in light sampling do. The light sampling render also exhibits 
			better overall color accuracy, as the direct lighting computation is more focused on the actual 
			light contributions, ensuring the colors are more aligned with the sceneâ€™s light sources.

		<h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
		<p>The implementation:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The function <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance</code> computes radiance for a ray after at least one bounce, considering both direct and indirect lighting.</li>
			<li>First, it transforms the ray's coordinate system from world space to object space (<code>o2w</code> and <code>w2o</code>) using the intersection normal.</li>
			<li>The intersection point (<code>hit_p</code>) is calculated by adding the ray's origin and direction scaled by the intersection distance.</li>
			<li>The outgoing direction (<code>w_out</code>) is transformed from world space to object space.</li>
			<li>Radiance <code>L_out</code> is initialized to zero, which will accumulate indirect lighting contributions.</li>
			<li>For rays with depth greater than 1, indirect lighting is simulated by using a coin flip (<code>roulette = 0.35</code>) to decide whether to continue path tracing.</li>
			<li>If the coin flip succeeds, the BSDF is sampled to get the next ray direction (<code>wi</code>) and the corresponding probability density function (<code>pdf</code>).</li>
			<li>If the PDF is positive and the BRDF value is significant, the next ray is generated and traced.</li>
			<li>If the next ray hits an intersection, the radiance is recursively calculated using <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance</code> and combined with the current radiance using the reflectance formula.</li>
			<li>The function returns the accumulated radiance <code>L_out</code>, which includes the indirect lighting contribution.</li>

				<h4>
					Explain in your write-up what you see for the 2nd and 3rd bounce of light, and how it 
					contributes to the quality of the rendered image compared to rasterization.
				</h4>
				In the 2nd bounce image, the underside of the bunny is illuminated because the light reflects 
				off the floor and bounces back onto the bunny. However, the fur on the head and back remains 
				darker since it was mainly lit during the first bounce, where the direct light hit the surface. 
				In the 3rd bounce image, the scene becomes significantly darker, with the bunny almost entirely 
				in shadows. This happens because the light from the 3rd bounce is scattered to other areas of the 
				scene, contributing less to the bunny's illumination. These additional bounces allow for more 
				accurate rendering of indirect lighting, shadows, and reflections, which rasterization typically 
				struggles to handle. As a result, path tracing produces a more realistic and physically accurate 
				image by simulating how light behaves in a real-world environment.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				<h4>
					Compare rendered views of accumulated and unaccumulated bounces
				</h4>
				As shown in the images above, each bounce adds more information to the scene by illuminating 
				additional areas. In the first image, with max_ray_depth = 0, only the light source is visible, 
				contributing to zero-bounce lighting. In the second image, with max_ray_depth = 1, the light 
				bounces off the floor and illuminates the top of the bunny. With subsequent bounces, the underside 
				of the bunny becomes more visible as the light reflects off the floor and walls. These additional 
				bounces help to distribute the light more evenly, creating a more realistic and natural diffusion 
				of light throughout the scene.

		<h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The function <code>raytrace_pixel</code> traces multiple rays through a pixel and averages the resulting radiance to determine the final color.</li>
			<li>The maximum number of samples per pixel is set by <code>ns_aa</code>, and adaptive sampling is used to reduce the number of samples for pixels that converge quickly.</li>
			<li>For each sample, a random offset within the pixel is generated using <code>gridSampler->get_sample()</code>, and a ray is created using <code>camera->generate_ray</code>.</li>
			<li>The ray's radiance is computed using <code>est_radiance_global_illumination</code> and added to the accumulated radiance.</li>
			<li>To implement adaptive sampling, the algorithm tracks the sum of illuminance values (<code>s1</code>) and their squares (<code>s2</code>) to compute the mean (<code>Î¼</code>) and variance (<code>ÏƒÂ²</code>).</li>
			<li>Every <code>samplesPerBatch</code> samples, the convergence criterion is checked. The confidence interval <code>I</code> is calculated as <code>1.96Â² * ÏƒÂ² / n</code> and compared against the cutoff <code>maxToleranceÂ² * Î¼Â²</code>.</li>
			<li>If the pixel meets the convergence criterion, sampling stops early, preventing unnecessary computation.</li>
			<li>Once the pixel converges or reaches the maximum samples, the average radiance is stored in the <code>sampleBuffer</code> and the sample count is updated in <code>sampleCountBuffer</code>.</li>
