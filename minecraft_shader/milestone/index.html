        <h3 class="card-title">Progress Summary</h3>
        <p>
            To establish a solid foundation, we initially focused on replicating the visual style of vanilla Minecraft. This provided a consistent baseline for further shader development and helped us verify that our rendering pipeline was functioning correctly across different systems.

            With the base visuals in place, we moved on to improving the lighting model. Our first implementation followed a simplified version of the Blinn-Phong lighting model, which calculates lighting based on three components: ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections. By combining these elements, we were able to simulate basic light interaction with block surfaces, resulting in more dynamic and visually appealing scenes.
            
            Seeking a more realistic effect, we later implemented a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) to calculate light reflectance more accurately at each fragment. This method, combined with our existing ambient lighting calculations, produced better visual results. As a result, we adopted the BRDF-based approach for our final lighting model moving forward.
            
            We have recently begun work on implementing shadows within the shader. While we have laid the groundwork, we are currently facing several technical challenges and bugs related to depth calculations and shadow mapping. Resolving these issues is our next priority as we continue refining the realism and visual fidelity of our shader.

          <h3 class="card-title">Progress Relative to Plan</h3>
          <p>
            Despite needing to debug more than initially expected, our progress is closely aligned with our Week 2 goals. We’ve completed the setup phase and successfully implemented base lighting features in our shader. We’re currently finalizing and debugging the shadows implementation.
