		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>
			De Casteljau’s algorithm is a way to evaluate Bezier curves by repeatedly interpolating between control points. 
			It works by taking a set of points and blending them step by step using a parameter t, which ranges from 0 to 1. 
			With each step, new intermediate points are created by moving between the original points, and this process continues 
			until only one point remains. That final point is the position on the Bezier curve for the given t
		</p>
		<p>
			In my implementation, I wrote a function that takes a list of 2D points and calculates the next set of intermediate 
			points using linear interpolation. It loops through the points, computes the blended values, and stores them in a new list. 
			This function only performs one step of the process, so it needs to be called multiple times until just one point is left. 
			That final point is what defines the curve at that specific t.

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		De Casteljau’s algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by applying the same process twice—once for each direction. 
		First, it evaluates along u to reduce each row of control points to a single point. 
		Then, it evaluates along v using those points to get the final point on the surface. <br />
		I implemented this by first computing intermediate points for each row using the same recursive 
		interpolation method from Bezier curves. After that, I applied the same process to the new set of points along v to find the final surface point.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		To implement the area-weighted vertex normals, I went through each face connected to the vertex using the half-edge structure. 
		For each face, I calculated the normal by taking the cross product of two edge vectors. I then weighted each face normal by its 
		area and accumulated the results. After processing all faces, I normalized the sum to get the final vertex normal. 
		This method gives more importance to larger faces, creating a smoother, more accurate normal for the vertex based on its surrounding geometry.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		In implementing the edge flip, I restructured the relationships between halfedges, vertices, and faces to reflect the new configuration of the mesh. 
		Specifically, I swapped the adjacent halfedges and ensured all connections (such as next, twin, and face) 
		were updated correctly for the new triangles. An important debugging technique I used was leveraging the 'check_for(...)'
		function to track element references and ensure the integrity of mesh relationships after the flip. 
		This helped catch issues with disconnected elements or invalid pointers.

				  <figcaption>Some edge flips</figcaption>

			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		In implementing the edge split operation, I used some ideas from Part 4, such as managing the relationships between halfedges, vertices, and faces. 
		Specifically, I reused the strategy for updating halfedge neighbors and ensuring all pointers are correctly set for each element in the mesh. 
		The key concept was ensuring that after the edge split, all neighboring halfedges and faces are correctly linked, just as we did when managing the 
		relationships between elements during the edge flip operation in Part 4.

		</div>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		First, I used the Loop subdivision rule to figure out new positions for the vertices and edges, saving these in 
		Vertex::newPosition and Edge::newPosition. Next, I split every edge in the original mesh, making sure to mark new edges 
		using Edge::isNew. After that, I flipped the edges connecting old and new vertices. Finally, I updated the positions of 
		the vertices in the mesh to match the new values, ensuring everything was smooth and accurately subdivided. 
		A key trick was keeping track of the difference between the original and new mesh elements to ensure everything was subdivided correctly.
